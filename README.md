<h3>Steps Taken to Complete the Project</h3>
    <li>Drew up a couple of different wireframes as well as an ERD to prep for my project.</li>
    <li>Set up a personal workflow schedule with deadlines in which I wanted to hit. Also made a personal requriements checklist to help keep me organized.</li>
    <li>Decided to attack the backend of my project first by creating my one to many relationship which is users to countries. A user has_many ==< countries.</li>
    <li>After creating a basic backend I then switched to the front end and created a basic page layout.</li>
    <li>Created the authorization for users. Users can sign-up, sign-in, sign-out and change their password.</li>
    <li>Created fields for users to add countries to their list.</li>
    <li>Created a button for users to get a list of all their countries.</li>
    <li>Created the relationships for the front and backend of the application to work together.</li>
